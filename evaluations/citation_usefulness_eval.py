"""Does a retrieved span answer the question it was fetched to answer?

Distinct from `citation_eval.py`, and the distinction is the whole point.
That one asks whether a span *entails a claim* -- the question a citation
answers once it is in a report. This one asks whether a span answers the
*question the search was serving*, which is a fact nothing in this repo
could express until deep research made the question a first-class
artifact and Stage B persisted it beside the query
(``retrieval_calls.question``).

The two come apart in the case that matters most for a research loop: a
span on exactly the right subject that answers a different question. A
paper about embryonic expression is squarely on-topic for a question
about adult expression and answers none of it. That is the shape of
retrieval failure a follow-up round exists to catch, and it is invisible
to any measure of topical overlap -- which is also why the deterministic
baseline here is expected to score badly on precisely those items and is
kept as a floor rather than as the answer.

Labels: ``useful`` (answers the question, in either direction -- a span
saying the trial failed is as useful as one saying it succeeded),
``partial`` (bears on the question without settling it), ``useless``
(same topic, different question, or no bearing).

**Offline by default**: the deterministic baseline is lexical coverage of
the question's content words, needs nothing, and is a floor. ``--llm``
scores a real model against the same panel and is the mode worth
believing; it needs a provider key. Unlike the entailment panel there is
no production assessor to score here -- the system does not yet judge its
own retrievals this way, so this eval's judge is the eval's own.
