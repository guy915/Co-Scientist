# ALS illustrative example — Generation agent output (hypothesis + proposal)

Research goal Develop a novel hypothesis for the key factor or process which contributes to ALS progression ... We can use iPSC cells for the in-vitro experiments. ...

#### Introduction

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the selective loss of motor neurons, leading to progressive muscle weakness, paralysis, and ultimately death. While the exact cause of ALS remains unknown, a complex interplay of genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and age-related cellular changes is believed to contribute to its pathogenesis. ...

#### Recent findings and related research

Recent research has implicated several key players and processes in ALS. TDP-43, an RNA-binding protein, is found mislocalized and aggregated in the cytoplasm of affected neurons in the majority of ALS cases. This protein's ability to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has come under intense scrutiny, with evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this process leads to the formation of pathological aggregates. Further, impairments in nucleocytoplasmic transport, the process by which molecules move between the nucleus and cytoplasm, have been observed in ALS and linked to TDP-43 pathology. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a cellular response to protein misfolding, has also been implicated as a potential contributing factor.

#### Hypothesis

Cellular stress (including but not limited to ER stress) induces post-translational modifications (PTMs) on specific FG-Nups (focusing initially on Nup98 and Nup62) at the nuclear pore complex (NPC). These Nup PTMs modify the interaction between these Nups and TDP-43, leading to altered TDP-43 dynamics and increased retention at the NPC. This increased retention at the NPC, in turn, triggers the disruption of nucleocytoplasmic transport.

#### Rationale and specificity

Instead of making the hypothesis about LLPS, we are making it much more specific but with the same starting point. Cellular stress, a broad concept encompassing various cellular insults, can trigger a cascade of molecular events. A key consequence of stress response is altered protein structure and function, which can be mediated by PTMs. Nuclear pore proteins, particularly FG-Nups like Nup98 and Nup62, form a "hydrogel" or selective barrier at the NPC, regulating the movement of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm. We hypothesize that specific PTMs on these FG-Nups (e.g., phosphorylation, O-GlcNAcylation initially) directly alter their interaction with TDP-43. TDP-43, known to interact with the NPC and be involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, may get inappropriately trapped or retained at the NPC when interacting with PTM-modified Nups. This trapping alters TDP-43 dynamics (even if not disrupting LLPS directly initially), meaning it cannot perform its normal functions and disrupting nucleocytoplasmic transport, which we know is happening in ALS. Since even a small change in transport could lead to downstream problems, this is a plausible initial event with testable consequences. The specific FG-Nups (Nup98/62) and chosen PTMs (phosphorylation/O-GlcNAcylation) provide a concrete starting point for experimentation. This mechanism directly links cellular stress to TDP-43 dysfunction and the key ALS pathology of defective nucleocytoplasmic transport by invoking a novel interaction mechanism at the NPC – all testable in vitro.

#### Experimental design and validation

Cell Types: Human iPSC-derived motor neurons from healthy controls and ALS patients. Stress Induction: Induce cellular stress using established pharmacological agents (e.g., tunicamycin for ER stress, arsenite for oxidative stress, oligomycin A for mitochondrial stress) and physical stressors (heat shock). Test different stressors individually and in combination. This broadened approach allows for a more robust investigation of the stress response.

Nup PTM Analysis: Assess PTMs of Nup98 and Nup62 specifically using mass spectrometry and immunoblotting with PTM-specific antibodies (specifically looking for phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation). Focus the analysis on these two.
