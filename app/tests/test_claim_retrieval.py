    "Acute myeloid leukemia remains difficult to treat, and the contribution "
    "of kinase X to disease maintenance has not been established in primary "
    "material. We profiled expression across sixty-one primary specimens and "
    "eleven established lines, then applied a selective small-molecule "
    "antagonist alongside cytarabine and an isotype-matched vehicle control. "
    "Target engagement was verified by phosphoproteomic readout at three "
    "separate residues. Blocking the kinase curtailed tumor "
    "proliferation in every AML model tested, with cell-cycle arrest at the "
    "G1 checkpoint and induction of apoptosis in treated cells within "
    "forty-eight hours. Colony formation from healthy donor progenitors was "
    "unaffected at equivalent concentrations, suggesting a usable "
    "therapeutic window. Transcriptional profiling implicated downstream "
    "signaling through the canonical survival axis rather than off-target "
    "activity. These results support further evaluation of this strategy in "
