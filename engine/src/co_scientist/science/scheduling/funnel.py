"""Depth is spent on finalists: the ranked leaders the report features.

Every idea gets the safety screen and one screening review and enters the
tournament. Observation, full and simulation reviews, deep verification and
claim checks run only for the top finalists by Elo among ideas that have
played, so a first cycle spends nothing on depth and ideas that lose never
pay for it. A deep-verification verdict, written on success and on failure,
marks an idea as having had its depth.
