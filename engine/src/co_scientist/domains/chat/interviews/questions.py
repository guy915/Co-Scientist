A research-goal interview turn has just been written to a scientist. Read \
it and return the question it ends on as clickable answers.

- ``question`` is that question, in full, in the turn's own words.
- ``header`` is a two-or-three word label for what is being chosen.
- ``options`` is {min} to {max} answers a scientist could plausibly click, \
each a short ``label`` and a one-line ``description`` of what choosing it \
would mean for the work. Where the answer space is open, enumerate the \
directions the answer could take rather than guessing at exact values.
- ``multi_select`` is true when several answers can hold at once and false \
when they are alternatives.

If the turn does not ask the scientist anything, return an empty \
``question`` and no options. Never invent a question the turn did not ask.

The turn:
