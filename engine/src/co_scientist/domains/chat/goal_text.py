_TITLE_PROMPT = (
    "You generate the sidebar title for a research session. Given the "
    "session's research goal, reply with a short title summarizing its "
    "subject.\n"
    "\n"
    "Rules:\n"
    "- The title MUST be 3 to 6 words and MUST summarize the goal, not "
    "repeat its opening words.\n"
    "- Put the most distinctive words first: the disease, organism, "
    "molecule, method, or system the goal is about. DO NOT begin with an "
    "article or a preposition.\n"
    "- DO NOT begin with the goal's framing verb or question word, such as "
    "'Find', 'Propose', 'Develop', 'Investigate', 'How', or 'What'.\n"
    "- Use Title Case. Write the title in the same language as the goal; "
    "where the goal has typos, infer the intended wording.\n"
    "- DO NOT use colons, quotation marks, or trailing punctuation.\n"
    "- DO NOT use words like 'research', 'goal', 'study', 'session', or "
    "'title' unless they carry real meaning in the goal.\n"
    "- Reply with the title alone, as a standalone string: no preamble, no "
    "explanation, no surrounding data structure.\n"
    "\n"
    "Examples:\n"
    "\n"
    "Goal: Find drug repurposing candidates that could slow the "
    "progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n"
    "Title: Drug Repurposing in ALS\n"
    "\n"
    "Goal: What mechanisms allow senescent cells to escape immune "
    "clearance in aged tissue?\n"
    "Title: Senescent Cell Immune Escape\n"
    "\n"
    "Goal: Propose experiments testing whether ferroptosis regulators can "
    "be targeted in pancreatic cancer.\n"
    "Title: Ferroptosis Targets in Pancreatic Cancer\n"
    "\n"
    "Goal: How does antibiotic resistance emerge in Pseudomonas "
    "aeruginosa biofilms, and how might it be disrupted?\n"
    "Title: Pseudomonas Biofilm Antibiotic Resistance\n"
    "\n"
    "Goal: Develop a computational model of tau propagation across "
    "cortical networks.\n"

    "report. Given the goal, reply with a fresh narrative restatement of "
    "it.\n"
    "\n"
    "Rules:\n"
    "- Write 1 to 3 sentences of plain prose, one paragraph, describing "
    "what the research seeks to discover or explain.\n"
    "- Restate the goal in DIFFERENT words -- do not repeat its phrasing or "
    "echo its opening clause.\n"
    "- Write in the third person about the research itself; do not address "
    "the reader, and do not refer to yourself, the report, or 'the goal'.\n"
    "- Do NOT add any heading, label, preamble, bullet, or quotation "
    "marks; reply with the paragraph alone.\n"
    "- Write in the same language as the goal; where the goal has typos, "
    "infer the intended wording.\n"
    "\n"
    "Example:\n"
    "\n"
    "Goal: Find drug repurposing candidates that could slow the "
    "progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n"
    "Restatement: This investigation seeks existing, already-approved "
    "drugs that might be redirected to decelerate the neurodegeneration "
    "characteristic of ALS, identifying candidates whose known mechanisms "
    "plausibly intersect the disease's progression."
