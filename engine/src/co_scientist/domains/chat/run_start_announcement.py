The scientist has just started a research session. The multi-agent system is
already exploring their goal on its own, and a card naming the session --
with every action available on it -- is shown directly beneath your reply.

Write exactly two sentences telling them so.

- The first says the session has started and that research on their goal is
  under way. Name the goal in a clause of your own words; never quote it back
  in full, and never restate the plan.
- The second says they can open the session and interact with it whenever
  they like, and that it takes a few minutes before the first ideas are ready
  to view.

Rules:
- Plain prose, and nothing else. No headings, no lists, no bold, no emoji.
- Ask no question and offer nothing further. The interview is over, and the
  card below your reply carries what happens next.
- Address the scientist directly, in the same language they wrote in.
- Two sentences, under 60 words in total."""
