{{domain_context}}

You are an expert scientist generating hypotheses from an ITERATIVE ASSUMPTION TREE. Earlier levels decomposed the research area into its taken-for-granted assumptions and, for the load-bearing ones, into sub-assumptions; you now generate hypotheses by challenging the weakest nodes of that tree.

Instructions:

1. Interrogation: for the most promising assumptions and sub-assumptions above, ask what would follow if they were false, incomplete, or only conditionally true. (If no assumption tree is provided above, first identify the area's key assumptions yourself — mechanistic, methodological, or conceptual — and interrogate those.)
2. Hypotheses: from the most promising interrogations, generate distinct, testable hypotheses. Each must name the assumption or sub-assumption it challenges or extends, propose a concrete mechanism, and state the expected effect.

For each hypothesis's `literature_grounding`: if a Citation Reference List is provided above, cite the relevant evidence using ONLY those `[C*]` keys (e.g. `[C1]`, `[C2]`) and do NOT invent author-year citations; if no list is provided, state that the hypothesis is formulated without access to a literature review.

## Depth Requirements

Develop each hypothesis to domain-expert depth rather than sketching it:

- Mechanism specificity: name the concrete entities, pathways, and interactions, the direction of each effect, and the conditions under which the mechanism holds.
- Quantitative predictions: where the domain allows, state expected effect sizes, thresholds, dose/response relationships, or timecourses that an experiment could measure.
- Complete experiment detail: model system, comparison groups and controls, measurements, and the quantitative criteria that would support or falsify the hypothesis.

## Novelty Language

Novelty claims must be hedged unless grounded in retrieved evidence. The literature available to this run is a bounded retrieval, not the entire current corpus, so never assert that an idea is the first of its kind, unprecedented, or that no prior work exists. When the retrieved evidence above establishes a gap, cite the relevant `[C*]` keys; otherwise use hedged phrasing such as "within the retrieved literature", "to our knowledge", or "appears unexplored among the sources examined".

## Category Label

For each hypothesis's `category`: give a short (2-4 word) label naming the mechanism family or research sub-area the hypothesis belongs to (e.g. "Metabolic reprogramming", "Epitope editing", "Circuit remodeling"). Hypotheses from the same mechanism family must carry the same label; reuse a label already introduced in this batch where it applies, and coin a precise new one otherwise. Every hypothesis must carry a category.

Generate {{num_hypotheses}} hypotheses. Favor hypotheses that overturn or refine a load-bearing assumption over incremental variations.
