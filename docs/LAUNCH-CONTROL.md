# Launch admission control

The API persists one operator-controlled pause in its SQLite store. No deploy
or restart is needed. A configured `LOGS_ADMIN_TOKEN`, sent privately as
`X-Logs-Token`, is required to read or update the control. Browser identity,
loopback addresses and forwarded headers do not grant authority.

Open `/operations` on the site, enter the operator token and select **Load
control**. Select **Pause new work; let current work finish** for the default
pause, or the explicit cancellation option to stop current work as well.
Set one short visitor message and optionally a future return time in your
local timezone, then **Apply control**. The token stays only in page memory;
closing or navigating away clears it. Reload before acting on a conflict.
The shared visitor banner polls the read-only status every three seconds
while visible and refreshes on return to the tab. Stop/cancel remains usable.

`GET /api/launch-control` returns the current revision and the private numeric
credit snapshot. `PUT /api/launch-control` requires `expected_revision` from
that read. A stale revision returns 409; reload rather than overwriting
another operator's decision. These responses are not cached. Keep the token
in a private operator client, never a URL, browser storage or a posted command.

Example PUT body:

```json
{
  "paused": true,
  "drain": false,
  "message": "Research is paused while we restore free capacity.",
  "resumes_at": null,
  "expected_revision": 0
}
```

- `paused: true` refuses new runs, starts, continuations and interview/Q&A
  replies with 503. Reads, health, deletion, cancellation and operator control
  remain reachable. Guards recheck run creation/start/continuation inside
  their existing short admission transactions; replies admit before dispatch.
- `drain: false` lets admitted work finish, including an admitted reply.
- `drain: true` cooperatively cancels queued/running/synthesizing/parked runs,
  revokes their durable tasks and closes admitted chat producers. Workers
  check only a primary-key ownership scalar on their existing ≤1-second tick;
  renewal retains its own cadence. Silent replies observe drain within one
  second, with one producer task and bounded fragment backpressure.
- A cancellation can leave an already dispatched provider outcome billable.
  Charged/reserved money and unknown token reservations stay intact. Cancelled
  work is not automatically restarted on resume.
- `resumes_at` is an optional future Unix timestamp, shown in the visitor's
  local timezone. It is an estimate, never an automatic unpause timer.
- Resume explicitly with `paused: false`, `drain: false`, `resumes_at: null`
  and the latest revision. A persisted drain generation still closes an old
  reply even if an operator resumes immediately afterward.

The control writes only on an explicit operator update, using a short durable
transaction. A new store defaults to unpaused without inserting a row on
reads; restarts and backup restores retain a saved pause. No SQLite writer is
held over network I/O. Startup adds only the singleton schema, with no scan
or task recovery on the binding path.

`GET /api/launch-status` is public and read-only. It returns only the current
reason, public message, expected return instant and free-run availability;
it exposes no researcher IDs, keys or balances. Pause reads are immediate.
The numeric credit aggregate is cached for at most three seconds to avoid a
lifetime-ledger scan per visitor. Free daily capacity returns the next UTC
midnight; current concurrency and exhausted/expired Azure credit have no
invented reset time. The ledger remains authoritative at physical dispatch;
this notice never reserves, refunds or authorizes a provider call. Remaining
free routes or the visitor's own key may still work after Azure is unavailable.

The authenticated operator endpoint has its own two-request buffer and a
4096-byte body limit. It does not consume anonymous visitor write allowances,
so a quota-exhaustion or erased browser identity cannot prevent unpause.

Offline regression coverage exercises token refusal, actual process restart,
expired ETA without auto-resume, all refused ingress paths, create/start
races, continuation transactions, read-only polls while the writer is held,
default reply completion, ContextVar isolation, silent reply/worker
cancellation, rapid resume, stale revisions, real quota/spend notices and
preservation of unknown paid reservations. No live provider call is needed.
